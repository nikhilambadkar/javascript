//On the basis of how we keep data in memory & how we access them, we have only types
//Primitive
//Non-Primitive (reference type)


/*
PRIMITIVE 
   Call by value 
   They are of 7 types
   1) String
   2) Number
   3) Boolean
   4) null
   5) undefined
   6) Symbol

NON-PRIMITIVE (Reference type)
   1) Array
   2) Objects
   3) Functions
   

   Javascript is dynamically typed language as we know that we did not 
   define type of data/variable it is


   Example of symbol:-
    const id=Symbol('123');
   const anotherId=Symbol('123');

   console.log(id);
   console.log(anotherId);
   console.log(id===anotherId);
